# Beth Gross â€” Data & Analytics

Welcome! I am Beth Gross, and you've landed on my **working notes**. This is where I share my thoughts, projects and interesting finds. Consider this a "thoughts in progress" space, so please excuse any typos or half-baked ideas. Some things will be just wrong... so keep that **critical thinking** cap on.  

I'm mostly focused on data and analytics, but my curious mind strays into other areas like cybersecurity, ai ethics and psychology.
